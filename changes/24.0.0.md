* \[**BREAKING**\] Add taller slash, broken slash and broken zero variants for Zero. As a result, current variants are reordered (#1307, #1509, #1678).
* \[**BREAKING**\] Rectify the variant atlas. As a result, if a character's variant list has motion-serifed, then it will have serifless and serifed variants: the serifed-ness will no longer be controlled by SLAB variable. The characters influenced are `M`, `N`, `P`, `R`, `U`, `V`, `W`, `b`, `h`, `m`, `n`, `p`, `q`, `u`, `v`, `w`, `y`.
* Add Characters:
  - CIRCLED ANTICLOCKWISE-ROTATED DIVISION SIGN (`U+29BC`).
  - CIRCLED WHITE BULLET (`U+29BE`).
  - CIRCLED BULLET (`U+29BF`).
  - SQUARED RISING DIAGONAL SLASH (`U+29C4`) ... SQUARED SQUARE (`U+29C8`).
  - REVERSE SOLIDUS OPERATOR (`U+29F5`) ... REVERSE SOLIDUS WITH HORIZONTAL STROKE (`U+29F7`).
  - PLUS SIGN WITH SMALL CIRCLE ABOVE (`U+2A22`) ... PLUS SIGN WITH TILDE ABOVE (`U+2A24`).
  - PLUS SIGN WITH TILDE BELOW (`U+2A26`).
  - PLUS SIGN IN LEFT HALF CIRCLE (`U+2A2D`).
  - PLUS SIGN IN RIGHT HALF CIRCLE (`U+2A2E`).
  - MULTIPLICATION SIGN IN LEFT HALF CIRCLE (`U+2A34`) ... CIRCLED MULTIPLICATION SIGN WITH CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT (`U+2A36`).
  - CIRCLED DIVISION SIGN (`U+2A38`).
  - ALMOST EQUAL TO WITH CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT (`U+2A6F`).
  - HYPHEN WITH DIAERESIS (`U+2E1A`).
  - TILDE WITH RING ABOVE (`U+2E1B`).
  - DOUBLE HYPHEN (`U+2E40`).
* Add diagonal-tailed variants for lowercase Iota (#1737).
* Make `VXSF` to influence Eth too (#1738).
