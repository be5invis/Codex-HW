* \[**BREAKING**\] Add taller slash, broken slash and broken zero variants for Zero. As a result, current variants are reordered (#1307, #1509, #1678).
* \[**BREAKING**\] Add above-baseline crossed variant for Q. As a result, current variants are reordered (#1533).
* \[**BREAKING**\] Rectify the variant atlas. As a result, if a character's variant list has motion-serifed, then it will have serifless and serifed variants: the serifed-ness will no longer be controlled by SLAB variable. The characters influenced are `M`, `N`, `P`, `R`, `U`, `V`, `W`, `b`, `h`, `m`, `n`, `p`, `q`, `u`, `v`, `w`, `y`.
* Add diagonal-tailed variants for lowercase Iota (#1737).
* Make `VXSF` to influence Eth too (#1738).
