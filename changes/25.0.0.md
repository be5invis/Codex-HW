* \[**BREAKING**\] Add middle serifed and XH serifed variants for Long S (`U+017F`) without a baseline serif. As a result, current variants are reordered (#1807).
* Add Characters:
  - CIRCLED DOLLAR SIGN WITH OVERLAID BACKSLASH (`U+1F10F`).
  - CIRCLED C WITH OVERLAID BACKSLASH (`U+1F16E`).
* Fix reversed shape of `U+1D12` (#1814).
* Improve density of quadruple arrows for better legibility at smaller font sizes.
